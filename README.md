# **Wine Quality Prediction**

# 📌 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing wine quality using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict the quality of wine (rated on a scale) based on its physicochemical features such as acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol content, and more.

# 📂 **Dataset**

* Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository – Wine Quality Dataset

* Two datasets: Red wine and White wine

* Features include:

   * Fixed acidity
  
   * Volatile acidity
  
   * Citric acid
  
   * Residual sugar
  
   * Chlorides
  
   * Free sulfur dioxide
  
   * Total sulfur dioxide
  
  * Density
  
  * pH
  
  * Sulphates
  
  * Alcohol

* Target variable: Quality (score between 0 and 10)

# **⚙️ Methodology**

↪ Data Preprocessing

  * Handling missing values
  
  * Normalization/Scaling of features
  
  * Splitting into train/test datasets

↪ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  * Distribution of wine quality
  
  * Correlation heatmap of features
  
  * Boxplots and histograms

↪ Modeling

  * Machine learning models used (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, XGBoost)
  
  * Model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix

↪ Results

  Best-performing model identified
  
  Key features influencing wine quality


# 📊 **Results**

Identified that alcohol, volatile acidity, sulphates are strong indicators of wine quality.

Achieved model accuracy of around XX% (replace with your actual result).

# 🔮 **Future Work**

Improve prediction with deep learning models.

Deploy as a web app using Flask/Django.

Build a recommendation system for wine quality.
